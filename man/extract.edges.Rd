\title{extract.edges}
\usage{
extract.edges(NBS.obj, clust.no = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{NBS.obj}{A list object generated from an earlier \code{NBS()} analysis}

\item{clust.no}{the cluster number (reported in the earlier NBS results) of the network to be masked. Set to 1 by default}
}
\value{
Returns a list object containing
\itemize{
\item \code{clust.tstat} thresholded edge-wise t-statistics.Edges not belonging to this cluster will be zeroed.
\item \code{clust.pos.mask} A vector of 1s and 0s indicating the significant network-thresholded positive edges.
\item \code{clust.neg.mask} A vector of 1s and 0s indicating the significant network-thresholded negative edges.
}
}
\description{
Generates edge-wise masks for calculating subject-level network strengths
}
\details{
This function generates positive and negative masks (vectors of 1s and 0s), where 1s indicate a significant network-thresholded edge. These masks can then be used to perform a matrix multiplication with the vectorized FC matrices to object subject-level network strengths

extract.edges(model1,clust.no=1)
