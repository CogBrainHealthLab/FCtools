\usage{
intersubject_similarity(FC_data, outcome, mode = "diff", nperm = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{FC_data}{An N x E matrix containing the vectorized edges; where N = number of subjects, E=number of edges}

\item{outcome}{A numerical vector (single outcome) or matrix (multiple outcomes) containing the values of the outcome(s) of interest}

\item{mode}{When set to \code{"diff"}, FC similarity is calculated as absolute difference between the FC vectors of a pair of subjects. When set to \code{"corr"},FC similarity is calculated as 1 - (pearson's correlation coefficient between the FC vectors of a pair of subjects). Set to \code{"diff"} by default.}

\item{nperm}{number of permutations for the correlation test between FC similarity and outcome similarity}
}
\value{
a list object containing
\itemize{
\item \code{FC_difference_matrix} The FC difference matrix
\item \code{Outcome_difference_matrix} The outcome difference matrix
\item \code{permutation_data} The permuted correlation values
}
}
\description{
This function runs an intersubject similarity analysis to determine if there is a relationship between similarity in FC and similarity in one or multiple outcomes.
}
\details{
This function runs an intersubject similarity analysis to determine if there is a relationship between similarity in FC and similarity in one or multiple outcomes. The outcome(s) will be z-standardized prior to calculating the intersubject similarity in the outcome(s).
