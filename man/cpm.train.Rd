\usage{
cpm.train(data, outcome, p = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An N x E matrix containing the vectorized edges; where N = number of subjects, E=number of edges}

\item{outcome}{The outcome variable to predict}

\item{p}{The p-value threshold of a Pearson's correlation test between the feature and outcome that determines if the feature is selected. Set to 0.05 by default.}
}
\value{
Returns a list object containing
\itemize{
\item \code{weights} vector of 1s (positive edges), 0s and -1s (negative edges) indicating the selected edges
\item \code{pos.network.coef} linear regression coefficients of the positive network strength model
\item \code{neg.network.coef} linear regression coefficients of the negative network strength model
\item \code{both.network.coef} linear regression coefficients of the positive and negative network strength model
