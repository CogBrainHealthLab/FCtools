\title{cpm.predict}
\usage{
cpm.predict(model, test.data, network = "both")
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A list object generated using \code{cpm.train()}}

\item{test.data}{An N x E matrix containing the vectorized edges of subjects whose outcomes/scores are to be predicted. This matrix has to contain the same number of columns as the matrix of features used to train the CPM model}

\item{network}{A string to specify which network strength(\code{'positive'},\code{'negative'} or \code{'both'}) to use in the outcome prediction. Set to \code{'both'} by default}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of predicted outcomes if \code{network='positive'} or \code{network='negative'}.
In the case of \code{network='both'}, a data.frame containing the predicted scores using the positive, negative, and the combined positive + negative models will be returned
}
\description{
predicting scores using a previously trained CPM model
}
\details{
This function takes a previously trained CPM model's weights to calculate the positive and negative network strengths for each subject.
Then these network strengths are multiplied with the regression coefficients in the CPM model to compute a predicted score.
