\title{vectorizeFC}
\usage{
vectorizeFC(FC_dir, filename = "FCmat.rds", fisherz = TRUE, timeseries = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{FC_dir}{the directory containing the M x M matrices (saved as .csv files)}

\item{filename}{the output format of the concatenated group level matrix. Only filenames with the *.csv or *.rds extensions are accepted. The .rds format uses less disk space. Set to 'FCmat.rds' by default}

\item{fisherz}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} option specifying if the edge values should undergo a fisher-Z transformation. This would be applicable in cases and functional connectivity is calculated as a pearson's correlation coefficient. Set to \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{timeseries}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} option specifying if the parcellated timeseries are used as inputs. Set to \code{FALSE} by default.}
}
\value{
Depending on whether a filename with a .csv or .rds file extension is specified, outputs a .csv file containing the  N x ((M x M)-M)/2 matrix or a .rds file containing a list object: 1)N x ((M x M)-M)/2 matrix, 2) a vector of subject IDs.
}
\description{
vectorizing and concatenating and M x M matrices
}
\details{
This function reads the M x M matrices (saved as .csv files) in a directory, vectorizes and concatenates them into a single N x ((M x M)-M)/2 matrix. N= number of subjects; M=number of nodes in the connectome
