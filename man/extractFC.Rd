\arguments{
\item{wb_path}{The filepath to the workbench folder that you have previously downloaded and unzipped}

\item{base_dir}{The filepath to directory containing the subject folders. Set to \verb{fmriresults01/"} by default.}

\item{atlas}{The version (number of parcels) of the Schaefer atlas; it has to be in multiples of 100, from 100 to 1000. The specified atlas template will be automatically downloaded from here if it does not exist in the current directory.}

\item{motion.thresh}{the threshold used for scrubbing frames. Set to 0.25 by default.}

\item{scrub}{If set to TRUE, remove frames with excessive head motion (FD > 0.25) and also remove segments in between two time-points if the segment has less than 5 frames. This is the â€˜full scrubbing; method described in \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811913009117)}{Power et. al (2014)}. This is not recommended for task-based fMRI volumes.}

\item{motion.reg}{When set to \code{TRUE}, the 6 motion parameters (3 translation and 3 rotation), their derivatives and the squares of these parameters and their derivatives will be regressed out of the fMRI timeseries data. This motion regression procedure will only work if each subject folder contains a \code{Movement_Regressors.txt} file.}

\item{GSR}{If set to TRUE, global signal, its derivative and the squares of the global signal and its derivatives will be regressed out from the fMRI timeseries data.}

\item{bandpass}{Lower and upper limits of band pass filter. Signals below the lower limit and above the upper limit of the band pass filter will be eliminated. set to \code{c(0.01,0.1)} by default. Can turned off by setting to \code{NA}.}

\item{TR}{Temporal resolution of the fMRI data. Only used if bandpass is not \code{NA}.}

\item{task}{The name of the task (case-sensitive), without any numbers or acquisition direction labels}

\item{extension}{The filename extension of the fMRI volumes. Set to \verb{_Atlas_MSMAll_hp0_clean.dtseries.nii} by default}

\item{movement.extension}{The filename extension of the head motion files. Set to \code{Movement_Regressors.txt} by default. Note the head motion file should be a text file containing either a single column of numbers (RMS measurements), or at least 6 columns (3 displacement + 3 rotational vectors). If there are more than 6 columns, only the first 6 columns will be used to compute framewise displacement.}

\item{output_dir}{The output directory where the FC matrices and headmotion parameters will be saved. A default \code{output_dir} directory will be created if it does not exist.}

\item{output.timeseries}{When set to \code{TRUE}, the parcellated timeseries data will be output instead of the FC matrix.}

\item{overwrite}{If set to \code{FALSE}, subjects that already have their FC matrices in \code{output_dir} will be skipped. Set to \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{dir.check}{check the directory structure to ensure that each fMRI directory should only contain one fMRI file and at least one movement file. Set to \code{TRUE} by default.}

\value{
outputs M x M matrices in \verb{output_dir\\FCmat}, headmotion measurements in \verb{output_dir\\headmotion} and a summary headmotion measurements across all subjects \verb{output_dir\\report.csv}.

\description{
Extracting FC matrices from HCP-preprocessed fMRI volumes
}
\details{
This function extracts FC matrices from fMRI volumes preprocessed with the HCP pipeline with the option
of carrying out global signal regression and scrubbing. The directory structure and file names must adhere to the NDA/HCP data structure
and file naming conventions. \href{https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench)}{Connectome Workbench} has to be
installed prior to running the function.
