\usage{
check_cifti(
  filename = "check_cifti.csv",
  wb_path = "/home/junhong.yu/workbench/bin_rh_linux64"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{check the directory structure to ensure that each fMRI directory should only contain one fMRI file and at least one movement file. Set to \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{wb_path}{The filepath to the workbench folder that you have previously downloaded and unzipped. Set to \verb{/home/junhong.yu/workbench/bin_rh_linux64} by default}
}
\value{
outputs a .csv file with a N x 2 data.frame, with the columns of \code{filename} and `Non-zero_values``
}
\description{
function to count number of 0 columns in cifti files
}
\details{
This function searches for all *_space-fsLR_den-91k_bold.dtseries.nii files recursively. Then these files are read one at a time, data from the left and right cortices and the subcortex are then \code{rbind} to form a 91282 x N matrix, where N is the number of frames. This matrix is summed rowwise, and the number of rowwise sums that are equal to 0 are counted. If there are no issues with the structural-functional alignment, there should only be 546 zero values
