\arguments{
\item{path}{The filepath to directory containing the subject folders. Set to \code{./.} by default.}

\item{wb_path}{The filepath to the workbench folder that you have previously downloaded and unzipped. Set to \verb{/home/junhong.yu/workbench/bin_rh_linux64} by default}

\item{dtseries}{The filename extension of the fMRI volumes. Set to \verb{_space-fsLR_den-91k_desc-denoised_bold.dtseries.nii} by default}

\item{timeseries}{If set to \code{TRUE}, FC matrices will not be computed, instead the parcellated timeseries will be return in a list format, where each subject's parcellated timeseries data is contained within a list element. Set to \code{FALSE} by default.}

\item{concat_subj}{When set to \code{TRUE} (default), timeseries data from multiple runs/sessions of the same subject is first Z-scaled and then concatenated into a single larger timeseries data frame before computing the FC.}

\item{atlas}{The version (number of parcels) of the Schaefer atlas; it has to be in multiples of 100, from 100 to 1000. set to \code{200} by default. The specified atlas template will be automatically downloaded from here if it does not exist in the current directory.}

\item{filename}{Filename of the concatenated FC vector file. Set to \code{FC.rds} by default}
}
\value{
outputs N (number of subjects) x E (number of unique) matrices as a .rds file
